Introducing ChessMate, a game that began as a modest 
15-112 project and is going to evolve into so much 
more. Initially, I embarked on ChessMate as an 
assignment, intending to complete it within the two 
week time frame given. However, my passion for continuous 
improvement led me to keep expanding its features, a 
process I still actively engage in today.
